# YouTubeVideoDownloader
This is a software that can download videos directly from youtube just by giving the URL of the Video.
Note: The software will say "not responding" once you click the download button. 
      The program will only respond once the download is over. So make sure not to
      close the application if you see "not responding" on the title bar.
      Sometimes it may pop up a window with options "Wait" and "Close program".
      Click wait. This will continue the download.
